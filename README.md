# Human Islet Transcriptome (HIT) Analysis

## Project overview

This repository contains the curated Human Islet Transcriptome (HIT): a comprehensive annotation of human pancreatic islet transcripts, integrating long‑read, short‑read, and CAGE sequencing data. The aim is to capture islet‑specific isoforms, promoters, and transcript start sites (TSSs), analyze their novelty relative to reference annotations (e.g. GENCODE), and explore their relevance for islet biology and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
